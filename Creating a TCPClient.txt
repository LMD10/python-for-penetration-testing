TCP Client
* gethostname() - It is considered good programming practice as you need to knwo the process of getting the IP address of the server. It gets the IP address of the host or the server
* He mentions that we would want to be using the encode function to avoid any errors 
* encode() - A parameter can be passed specifying the encoding type

How do we do it?
* There are not really any new functions involved excpet for maybe:
1. encode() -
2. decode() -
* We import the socket 
* We then create the client socket object with the same parameters as the one in the server 
* We need to make sure that the client does not the adress of the server 
* We then conncet to the socket and we would do that with the connect() fuinction from the clientsocket taken in as parameters the host or server address and the port 
* Now before in the server we encoded the message. So we need to recieve the message
* We can then use the recv() function and specify the buffer size which specifies the max amount of data that can pass through the port 
* We can use the same unit of factorisation to increase to like 2048
* Since we have recieved then now we need to decode the message
* He then closes the clientsocket before printing the decoded message
