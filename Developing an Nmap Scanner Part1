Developing an Nmap scanner
* We are going to be using the python programming language tools to automate tasks and contribute to the penetration testing lifecycle
* He is running this on kali linux

What is the aim?
* We are going to make a simple program which will ask the user for the foreign IP address that they want to scan 
* It will ask them for the type of scan that they would want like for example a SYN scan or a UDP scan or a complete comprehensive scan - OS fingerprinting, service fingerprinting, aggressive scanning and SYN scanning and the default scripts that come with nmap

How to do it
1. The first thing he mentions is that we need to install an nmap module in the following way in the kali linux environment:
pip3 install python-nmap
2. Then he goes about creating it where I specify more details in the comments
