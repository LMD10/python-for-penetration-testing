Plan for Projects 
* I dont have a lot of time thanks to uni so I need to work on two projects from the 5 mentioned to show my interest and demonstrate to employers that i have worked on this and enjoy this

I think that the most relevant ones would be:
1. SHA-1 Password Cracker 
2. Secure Real Time Multiplayer Game  

* I need to use everything that I have learned over the past few weeks which includes what is in Python for Pentration Testing and Information security with HelmetJS 
* We should start this by next Week Sunday
